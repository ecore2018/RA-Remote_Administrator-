RA is a very simple remote administrating system, with a client and a server.
For now you shuld can't use this programm.
Fist of all you must review the code and you have to redefine something.
For now, I can give you only these informations.
See you.

I'm very happy to tell you that the RA project's arrived to '1.0 Alpha' version!
The previous version didn't run for example! XD
Only "cd" shell command doesn't work at the moment.
You Can anyway use others commands and use the complete path to reference.
Now you can use this Alpha version to test it.
To comunicate something you think can be written better, or to comunicate some bug
or error, you can write at: federicogerardi94@gmail.com.
Thanks for attention.
